// MARK: - RevenueForecastEngine (Tokenized, Modular, Accessible Revenue Projections)

/**
 `RevenueForecastEngine` is a modular, tokenized, auditable engine responsible for revenue forecasting and projections within Furfolio.

 Furfolio is designed as an offline-first, owner-focused financial management platform. This engine supports Furfolioâ€™s mission by providing accurate, timely revenue forecasts that empower business owners to make informed decisions without requiring constant internet connectivity.

 The engine encapsulates multiple forecasting strategies, including simple linear projections, multi-month forecasts, and yearly revenue estimations, while providing extensibility points for UI integration and analytics.

 All UI summary and analytics outputs must utilize design tokens for color, font, and badge presentation to ensure consistency and accessibility. Audit and event hooks are integrated to enable comprehensive tracking and logging of forecast updates.

 This engine is built with extensibility, tokenization for UI, and audit logging in mind, ensuring a robust foundation for future enhancements.
