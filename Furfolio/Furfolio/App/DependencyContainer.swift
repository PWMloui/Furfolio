// MARK: - Best Practices

/*
 Usage Examples and Developer Guidance:

 1. Accessing Shared Dependencies:
    let auditLogger = DependencyContainer.shared.auditLogManager
    auditLogger.log(event: "User logged in")

 2. Using Test Container for Previews or Unit Tests:
    let testContainer = DependencyContainer.testInstance
    // Inject testContainer into view models or views for isolated testing

 3. Overriding Dependencies for Specific Tests:
    let customContainer = DependencyContainer()
    // Replace specific services with mocks or stubs
    customContainer.auditLogManager = MockAuditLogManager()
    // Use customContainer for targeted testing

 4. Legacy Migration Strategy:
    - Gradually replace legacy service calls with DependencyContainer references.
    - Refactor legacy code to accept dependencies via injection rather than direct instantiation.
    - Use DependencyContainer as a bridge to unify old and new services without duplication.

 5. Extending DependencyContainer:
    - Add new services or managers as properties.
    - Initialize them in the constructor with appropriate dependency injection.
    - Update testInstance to include mocks/stubs for new services.

 Remember:
 - Keep DependencyContainer as the single source of truth for dependencies.
 - Avoid creating services outside this container to maintain consistency.
 - Use TODO comments to track areas needing implementation or improvement.
