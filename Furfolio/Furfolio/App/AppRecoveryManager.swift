// MARK: - AppRecoveryManager (Backup, Export, Import, and Data Recovery)

/**
 AppRecoveryManager is a core component in the unified Furfolio architecture responsible for managing backup, export, import, and recovery of app data. It facilitates business resilience by ensuring data integrity and availability, supports audit and compliance requirements through structured data export/import, and lays the foundation for secure data handling.

 Architectural Intent and Usage:
 - This manager centralizes all data persistence recovery operations and enables consistent backup, export, and import workflows.
 - It is designed to be injected via the DependencyContainer and made available across all app modules to ensure unified data handling.
 - All backup, export, and import operations must be audited for compliance and integrate with the Furfolio Trust Center to enforce permissions and maintain audit logs.
 - This design supports offline and first-party backups, with future extensibility for cloud backup integrations.
 - Best practices include performing backups regularly, validating data integrity during import/export, and handling recovery scenarios gracefully to minimize data loss.

 Usage Patterns:
 - Use `createBackup` to generate local backups of the app’s database.
 - Use `exportData` and `importData` for structured JSON data interchange supporting audit, compliance, and migration.
 - Use `restoreBackup` and `checkForCrashAndRecover` to recover from failures or crashes.
 - Integrate with the Trust Center to ensure permissions and audit trails are consistently enforced.

 - TODO: Add encryption support to all persistence, export, and import operations to meet business privacy and compliance requirements.

 Aggregates all Furfolio model data for export and import operations. This struct consolidates diverse entities such as owners, dogs, appointments, charges, tasks, sessions, users, vaccination records, business info, and staff members.

 This aggregation facilitates:
 - Unified data export/import for audit, compliance, and migration.
 - Future-proofing by centralizing model data handling.
 - Simplified onboarding and demo scenarios via sampleData.

 Pattern for Extension:
 - As new models are added to Furfolio, extend this struct by adding corresponding properties and updating the initializer and sample data accordingly.
 - This approach maintains a single source of truth for export/import data structures, simplifying maintenance and evolution.

 - Note: Extend this struct as new models are added to Furfolio.
