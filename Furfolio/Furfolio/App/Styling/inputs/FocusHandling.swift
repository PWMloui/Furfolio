 FocusHandling.swift

 Architecture:
 This module provides a centralized focus management system designed with extensibility in mind. It supports asynchronous operations using async/await, enabling smooth integration with modern Swift concurrency patterns.

 Extensibility:
 The architecture allows easy extension of analytics logging, diagnostics, localization, and audit capabilities. Developers can conform to the FocusHandlingAnalyticsLogger protocol to implement custom analytics behavior.

 Analytics / Audit / Trust Center Integration:
 The FocusHandlingManager integrates audit logging and analytics event buffering to support Trust Center requirements and compliance auditing. Events are localized and stored in a capped buffer for diagnostics and review.

 Diagnostics:
 Diagnostic methods are stubbed for future implementation to help developers and administrators monitor focus state and event history.

 Localization:
 All user-facing and log event strings use NSLocalizedString with keys, default values, and descriptive comments to facilitate localization.

 Accessibility:
 Designed to support accessibility by managing focus states clearly and reliably (future enhancements planned).

 Compliance:
 The module is designed to support compliance with data logging and audit requirements by providing structured logs and localized messages.

 Preview / Testability:
 Includes a NullFocusHandlingAnalyticsLogger for use in previews, tests, and QA environments with console-only logging controlled via a testMode flag.

 This documentation aims to assist future maintainers and developers in understanding and extending the focus handling system.
